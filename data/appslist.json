Within the dashboards, any range of time can be chosen, and statistics and events from different times can be compared. \n\nAlthough the dashboards provided are useful, users are encouraged to customize, enhance, and clone the dashboards to create their own. The wealth of statistics and events from Capture Engines can also be correlated with other data in completely different dashboards. This is where the insight comes about how the network affects other aspects of the business, and vice versa.\n\nMore information about the Savvius Omnipliance and OmniPeek Capture Engines can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.savvius.com/products/all_products",

While everyday virus scanners are only configured to recognise malware such as viruses, trojans and exploit codes, THOR uses a series of more than 25 different checks to examine systems for typical attacker tools, activities in logs, anomalies in user accounts, sessions, network connections and other elements that may expose attacker activities.\n\nKey Features:\n- Scan for hacking tools and adversary activities\n- Portable \u2013 no installation needed\n- No windows requirements. (Windows version or installed software)\n- Adjustable to react on adversaries tactics, techniques and procedures\n- Scoring System to evaluate \u201cunknown\u201d files and identify malware\n- Several ways to export information (TXT, HTML, SYSLOG)\n- Throttling the scanning process possible\n\nThis Splunk App helps to manage the log data transmitted by THOR and facilitates the analysis. \n\nhttps://www.apt-detection.com",

Thus providing IT organizations with critical context to any network and security event identified within Splunk and enabling them to pivot into Security Analytics with the data from a specific event for quick and efficient workflow\n\nBlue Coat's Security Analytics Platform complements Splunk by acting as a camera on the network, providing clear, actionable intelligence about security threats to applications, files, and web content. With this retrospective look at traffic on the network, IT organizations can quickly identify the advanced and targeted attacks that slip past traditional prevention-based security tools.",

The README.txt provides usage and instructions on how to install and test it. Your Splunk instance must be running as root or sudo root access to call the ICMP protocol, which is what this uses from acknowledged public domain sources.\n\nNOTE: when starting Splunk as a root or Admin user, do NOT revert back to starting Splunk as a non-root or non-Admin user as the Splunk index files will be owned by root or Admin and Splunkd will not have permission to access them as an underprivileged user.

RSS feeds are supplied via a file passed on the command line. A sample file, feeds.txt, is provided for testing. You can modify that file and add your own feeds. This program uses the open source RssParser.java provided by a 3rd party acknowledged in the README.txt.\n\nTo Install, read the README.txt. This program was written for all those who want to use Java for reading RSS inputs in Java instead of using the Python version, which is also on Splunkbase. The program also uses the Splunk Java SDK (included jar) to check for duplicate links before indexing a feed entry.",

The next thing to do is index the newly required file into Splunk with a sourcetype.\n\nAt search time, you will then be able to decrypt the data. Read the README.txt for installation and usage. Two experimental dashboards have been added for Splunk 6+ that you can use in your own app.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Use as is as this is a reference implementation.",

The sqlinjection_stats(sourcetype, uri query field) macro is used to detect this. Simply copy macros.conf from default to the app's local directory and change the macro's where clause to match what may be typical of your own web site to find outliers.\n\nA combination of both these macros will help you find possible SQL Injection\nattempts.

Another benefit is that if log format changes, old and new logs will both continue to have correct fields.\n\nThe downside to this approach are the same as any index-time field extraction.  Index size may be increased and search performance may be reduced, and once the logs are input they are stuck with the fields they came with.  \n\nSome parts may be inspired by or derived from the Security Onion app by Brad Shoop and TA-Bro by Cedric Le Roux",
